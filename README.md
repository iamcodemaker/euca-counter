# Counter MVC using Euca

This is a counter MVC app I use as a smoke test for Euca. It contains a version
using `euca::Dom` for DOM generation and a version using `typed-html`.

## Building and Running

Use `npm run start` to build and run with parcel. Navigate to the local address
shown to demo the app. Change the include in `js/index.js` to change which
version of the app is loaded.
